Long answer, quoting from a mail to someone else:

Well, I can tell you that it assumes a POSIX system, both in available
utilities and system calls, So you'd need to use cygwin or something
like that. (Perhaps you already are for git, I think git also assumes a
POSIX system.) So you need a Haskell that can target that. What this
page refers to as \"GHC-Cygwin\":
<http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.6/html/building/platforms.html>
I don't know where to get one. Did find this:
<http://copilotco.com/mail-archives/haskell-cafe.2007/msg00824.html>

(There are probably also still some places where it assumes / as a path
separator, although I fixed some.)

FWIW, git-annex works fine on OS X and other fine proprietary unixen. ;P

Alternatively, windows versions of these functions could be found,
which are all the ones that need POSIX, I think. A fair amount of this,
the stuff to do with signals and users, could be empty stubs in windows.
The file manipulation, particularly symlinks, would probably be the main
challenge.
