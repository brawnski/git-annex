# NAME

git-union-merge - Join branches together using a union merge

# SYNOPSIS

git union-merge ref ref newref

# DESCRIPTION

Does a union merge between two refs, storing the result in the
specified newref.

The union merge will always succeed, but assumes that files can be merged
simply by concacenating together lines from all the oldrefs, in any order.
So, this is useful only for branches containing log-type data.

That this does not touch the checked out working copy. It operates
entirely on git refs and branches.

# EXAMPLE

	git union-merge git-annex origin/git-annex refs/heads/git-annex 

Merges the current git-annex branch, and a version from origin,
storing the result in the git-annex branch.

# BUGS

File modes are not currently merged.
