   * Minor bugfixes and error message improvements.
   * Massively sped up `git annex lock` by avoiding use of the uber-slow
     `git reset`, and only running `git checkout` once, even when many files
     are being locked.
   * Fix locking of files with staged changes.
   * Somewhat sped up `git commit` of modifications to unlocked files.
   * Build fix for older ghc."""]]
