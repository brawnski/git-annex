It's possible for data to accumulate in the annex that no files point to
anymore. One way it can happen is if you `git rm` a file without 
first calling `git annex drop`. And, when you modify an annexed file, the old
content of the file remains in the annex. Another way is when migrating
between backends.

This might be historical data you want to preserve, so git-annex defaults to
preserving it. So from time to time, you may want to check for such data and
eliminate it to save space.

	# git annex unused
	unused  (checking for unused data...) 
	  Some annexed data is no longer pointed to by any files in the repository.
	    NUMBER  KEY
	    1       WORM-s3-m1289672605--file
	    2       WORM-s14-m1289672605--file
	  (To see where data was previously used, try: git log --stat -S'KEY')
	  (To remove unwanted data: git-annex dropunused NUMBER)
	ok

After running `git annex unused`, you can follow the instructions to examine
the history of files that used the data, and if you decide you don't need that
data anymore, you can easily remove it:

	# git annex dropunused 1
	dropunused 1 ok

Hint: To drop a lot of unused data, use a command like this:

	# git annex dropunused `seq 1 1000`
