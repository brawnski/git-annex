git-annex (0.20110402) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Use lowercase hash directories for locationlog files, to avoid
    some issues with git on OSX with the mixed-case directories.
    No migration is needed; the old mixed case hash directories are still
    read; new information is written to the new directories.
  * Unused files on remotes, particulary special remotes, can now be
    identified and dropped, by using "--from remote" with git annex unused
    and git annex dropunused.
  * Clear up short option confusion between --from and --force (-f is now
    --from, and there is no short option for --force).
  * Add build depend on perlmagick so docs are consistently built.
    Closes: #621410
  * Add doc-base file. Closes: #621408
  * Periodically flush git command queue, to avoid boating memory usage
    too much.
  * Support "sha1" and "sha512" commands on FreeBSD, and allow building
    if any/all SHA commands are not available. Thanks, Fraser Tweedale

git-annex (0.20110401) experimental; urgency=low

  * Amazon S3 is now supported as a special type of remote.
    Warning: Encrypting data before sending it to S3 is not yet supported.
  * Note that Amazon S3 support is not built in by default on Debian yet,
    as hS3 is not packaged.
  * fsck: Ensure that files and directories in .git/annex/objects
    have proper permissions.
  * Added a special type of remote called a directory remote, which
    simply stores files in an arbitrary local directory.
  * Bugfix: copy --to --fast never really copied, fixed.

git-annex (0.20110328) experimental; urgency=low

  * annex.diskreserve can be given in arbitrary units (ie "0.5 gigabytes")
  * Generalized remotes handling, laying groundwork for remotes that are
    not regular git remotes. (Think Amazon S3.)
  * Provide a less expensive version of `git annex copy --to`, enabled
    via --fast. This assumes that location tracking information is correct,
    rather than contacting the remote for every file.
  * Bugfix: Keys could be received into v1 annexes from v2 annexes, via
    v1 git-annex-shell. This results in some oddly named keys in the v1
    annex. Recognise and fix those keys when upgrading, instead of crashing.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 28 Mar 2011 10:47:29 -0400

git-annex (0.20110325) experimental; urgency=low

  * Free space checking is now done, for transfers of data for keys
    that have free space metadata. (Notably, not for SHA* keys generated
    with git-annex 0.2x or earlier.) The code is believed to work on
    Linux, FreeBSD, and OSX; check compile-time messages to see if it
    is not enabled for your OS.
  * Add annex.diskreserve config setting, to control how much free space
    to reserve for other purposes and avoid using (defaults to 1 mb).
  * Add --fast flag, that can enable less expensive, but also less thorough
    versions of some commands.
  * fsck: In fast mode, avoid checking checksums.
  * unused: In fast mode, just show all existing temp files as unused,
    and avoid expensive scan for other unused content.
  * migrate: Support migrating v1 SHA keys to v2 SHA keys with
    size information that can be used for free space checking.
  * Fix space leak in fsck and drop commands.
  * migrate: Bugfix for case when migrating a file results in a key that
    is already present in .git/annex/objects.
  * dropunused: Significantly sped up; only read unused log file once.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Mar 2011 00:47:37 -0400

git-annex (0.20110320) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix dropping of files using the URL backend.
  * Fix support for remotes with '.' in their names.
  * Add version command to show git-annex version as well as repository
    version information.
  * No longer auto-upgrade to repository format 2, to avoid accidental
    upgrades, etc. Use git-annex upgrade when you're ready to run this
    version.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Mar 2011 16:36:33 -0400

git-annex (0.20110316) experimental; urgency=low

  * New repository format, annex.version=2.
  * The first time git-annex is run in an old format repository, it
    will automatically upgrade it to the new format, staging all
    necessary changes to git. Also added a "git annex upgrade" command.
  * Colons are now avoided in filenames, so bare clones of git repos
    can be put on USB thumb drives formatted with vFAT or similar
    filesystems.
  * Added two levels of hashing to object directory and .git-annex logs,
    to improve scalability with enormous numbers of annexed
    objects. (With one hundred million annexed objects, each
    directory would contain fewer than 1024 files.)
  * The setkey, fromkey, and dropkey subcommands have changed how
    the key is specified. --backend is no longer used with these.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 16 Mar 2011 16:20:23 -0400

git-annex (0.24) unstable; urgency=low

  Branched the 0.24 series, which will be maintained for a while to
  support v1 git-annex repos, while main development moves to the 0.2011
  series, with v2 git-annex repos.

  * Add Suggests on graphviz. Closes: #618039
  * When adding files to the annex, the symlinks pointing at the annexed
    content are made to have the same mtime as the original file.
    While git does not preserve that information, this allows a tool
    like metastore to be used with annexed files.
    (Currently this is only done on systems supporting POSIX 200809.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 16 Mar 2011 18:35:13 -0400

git-annex (0.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support ssh remotes with a port specified.
  * whereis: New subcommand to show where a file's content has gotten to.
  * Rethink filename encoding handling for display. Since filename encoding
    may or may not match locale settings, any attempt to decode filenames 
    will fail for some files. So instead, do all output in binary mode.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 12 Mar 2011 15:02:49 -0400

git-annex (0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Git annexes can now be attached to bare git repositories.
    (Both the local and remote host must have this version of git-annex
    installed for it to work.)
  * Support filenames that start with a dash; when such a file is passed
    to a utility it will be escaped to avoid it being interpreted as an
    option. (I went a little overboard and got the type checker involved
    in this, so such files are rather comprehensively supported now.)
  * New backends: SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224
    (Supported on systems where corresponding shaNsum commands are available.)
  * describe: New subcommand that can set or change the description of
    a repository.
  * Fix test suite to reap zombies.
    (Zombies can be particularly annoying on OSX; thanks to Jimmy Tang
    for his help eliminating the infestation... for now.)
  * Make test suite not rely on a working cp -pr.
    (The Unix wars are still ON!)
  * Look for dir.git directories the same as git does.
  * Support remote urls specified as relative paths.
  * Support non-ssh remote paths that contain tilde expansions.
  * fsck: Check for and repair location log damage.
  * Bugfix: When fsck detected and moved away corrupt file content, it did
    not update the location log.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 04 Mar 2011 15:10:57 -0400

git-annex (0.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * test: Don't rely on chmod -R working.
  * unannex: Fix recently introduced bug when attempting to unannex more
    than one file at a time.
  * test: Set git user name and email in case git can't guess values.
  * Fix display of unicode filenames.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Feb 2011 23:21:08 -0400

git-annex (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Preserve specified file ordering when instructed to act on multiple
    files or directories. For example, "git annex get a b" will now always
    get "a" before "b". Previously it could operate in either order.
  * unannex: Commit staged changes at end, to avoid some confusing behavior
    with the pre-commit hook, which would see some types of commits after
    an unannex as checking in of an unlocked file.
  * map: New subcommand that uses graphviz to display a nice map of
    the git repository network.
  * Deal with the mtl/monads-fd conflict.
  * configure: Check for sha1sum.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 08 Feb 2011 18:57:24 -0400

git-annex (0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * configure: Support using the uuidgen command if the uuid command is
    not available.
  * Allow --exclude to be specified more than once.
  * There are now three levels of repository trust.
  * untrust: Now marks the current repository as untrusted.
  * semitrust: Now restores the default trust level. (What untrust used to do.)
  * fsck, drop: Take untrusted repositories into account.
  * Bugfix: Files were copied from trusted remotes first even if their
    annex.cost was higher than other remotes.
  * Improved temp file handling. Transfers of content can now be resumed
    from temp files later; the resume does not have to be the immediate
    next git-annex run.
  * unused: Include partially transferred content in the list.
  * Bugfix: Running a second git-annex while a first has a transfer in
    progress no longer deletes the first processes's temp file.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 28 Jan 2011 14:31:37 -0400

git-annex (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bugfix: `copy --to` and `move --to` forgot to stage location log changes
    after transferring the file to the remote repository.
    (Did not affect ssh remotes.)
  * fsck: Fix bug in moving of corrupted files to .git/annex/bad/
  * migrate: Fix support for --backend option.
  * unlock: Fix behavior when file content is not present.
  * Test suite improvements. Current top-level test coverage: 80%

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 14 Jan 2011 14:17:44 -0400

git-annex (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * unannex: Now skips files whose content is not present, rather than
    it being an error.
  * New migrate subcommand can be used to switch files to using a different
    backend, safely and with no duplication of content.
  * bugfix: Fix crash caused by empty key name. (Thanks Henrik for reporting.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 09 Jan 2011 10:04:11 -0400

git-annex (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * git-annex-shell: Avoid exposing any git repo config except for the
    annex.uuid when doing configlist.
  * bugfix: Running `move --to` with a remote whose UUID was not yet known
    could result in git-annex not recording on the local side where the
    file was moved to. This could not result in data loss, or even a
    significant problem, since the remote *did* record that it had the file.
  * Also, add a general guard to detect attempts to record information
    about repositories with missing UUIDs.
  * bugfix: Running `move --to` with a non-ssh remote failed.
  * bugfix: Running `copy --to` with a non-ssh remote actually did a move.
  * Many test suite improvements. Current top-level test coverage: 65%

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 07 Jan 2011 14:33:13 -0400

git-annex (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support scp-style urls for remotes (host:path).
  * Support ssh urls containing "~".
  * Add trust and untrust subcommands, to allow configuring repositories
    that are trusted to retain files without explicit checking.
  * Fix bug in numcopies handling when multiple remotes pointed to the
    same repository.
  * Introduce the git-annex-shell command. It's now possible to make
    a user have it as a restricted login shell, similar to git-shell.
  * Note that git-annex will always use git-annex-shell when accessing
    a ssh remote, so all of your remotes need to be upgraded to this
    version of git-annex at the same time.
  * Now rsync is exclusively used for copying files to and from remotes.
    scp is not longer supported.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 31 Dec 2010 22:00:52 -0400

git-annex (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bugfix to git annex unused in a repository with nothing yet annexed.
  * Support upgrading from a v0 annex with nothing in it.
  * Avoid multiple calls to git ls-files when passed eg, "*".

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Dec 2010 17:38:48 -0400

git-annex (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Makefile: Install man page and html (when built).
  * Makefile: Add GHCFLAGS variable.
  * Fix upgrade from 0.03.
  * Support remotes using git+ssh and ssh+git as protocol.
    Closes: #607056

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 14 Dec 2010 13:05:10 -0400

git-annex (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add --exclude option to exclude files from processing.
  * mwdn2man: Fix a bug in newline supression. Closes: #606578
  * Bugfix to git annex add of an unlocked file in a subdir. Closes: #606579
  * Makefile: Add PREFIX variable.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Dec 2010 17:32:00 -0400

git-annex (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * If available, rsync will be used for file transfers from remote
    repositories. This allows resuming interrupted transfers.
  * Added remote.annex-rsync-options.
  * Avoid deleting temp files when rsync fails.
  * Improve detection of version 0 repos.
  * Add uninit subcommand. Closes: #605749

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 04 Dec 2010 17:27:42 -0400

git-annex (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * In .gitattributes, the annex.numcopies attribute can be used
    to control the number of copies to retain of different types of files.
  * Bugfix: Always correctly handle gitattributes when in a subdirectory of
    the repository. (Had worked ok for ones like "*.mp3", but failed for
    ones like "dir/*".)
  * fsck: Fix warning about not enough copies of a file, when locations
    are known, but are not available in currently configured remotes.
  * precommit: Optimise to avoid calling git-check-attr more than once.
  * The git-annex-backend attribute has been renamed to annex.backend.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Nov 2010 19:28:05 -0400

git-annex (0.09) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add copy subcommand.
  * Fix bug in setkey subcommand triggered by move --to.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 27 Nov 2010 17:14:59 -0400

git-annex (0.08) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix `git annex add ../foo` (when ran in a subdir of the repo).
  * Add configure step to build process.
  * Only use cp -a if it is supported, falling back to cp -p or plain cp
    as needed for portability.
  * cp --reflink=auto is used if supported, and will make git annex unlock
    much faster on filesystems like btrfs that support copy on write.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 21 Nov 2010 13:45:44 -0400

git-annex (0.07) unstable; urgency=low

  * find: New subcommand.
  * unused: New subcommand, finds unused data. (Split out from fsck.)
  * dropunused: New subcommand, provides for easy dropping of unused keys
    by number, as listed by the unused subcommand.
  * fsck: Print warnings to stderr; --quiet can now be used to only see
    problems.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 15 Nov 2010 18:41:50 -0400

git-annex (0.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * fsck: Check if annex.numcopies is satisfied.
  * fsck: Verify the sha1 of files when the SHA1 backend is used.
  * fsck: Verify the size of files when the WORM backend is used.
  * fsck: Allow specifying individual files if fscking everything
    is not desired.
  * fsck: Fix bug, introduced in 0.04, in detection of unused data.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Nov 2010 16:24:29 -0400

git-annex (0.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * Optimize both pre-commit and lock subcommands to not call git diff
    on every file being committed/locked.
    (This actually also works around a bug in ghc, that caused
    git-annex 0.04 pre-commit to sometimes corrupt filename being read
    from git ls-files and fail. 
    See <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/4493>
    The excessive number of calls made by pre-commit exposed the ghc bug.
    Thanks Josh Triplett for the debugging.)
  * Build with -O2.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Nov 2010 18:31:09 -0400

git-annex (0.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add unlock subcommand, which replaces the symlink with a copy of
    the file's content in preparation of changing it. The "edit" subcommand
    is an alias for unlock.
  * Add lock subcommand.
  * Unlocked files will now automatically be added back into the annex when
    committed (and the updated symlink committed), by some magic in the
    pre-commit hook.
  * The SHA1 backend is now fully usable.
  * Add annex.version, which will be used to automate upgrades
    between incompatible versions.
  * Reorganised the layout of .git/annex/
  * The new layout will be automatically upgraded to the first time
    git-annex is used in a repository with the old layout.
  * Note that git-annex 0.04 cannot transfer content from old repositories
    that have not yet been upgraded.
  * Annexed file contents are now made unwritable and put in unwriteable
    directories, to avoid them accidentially being removed or modified.
    (Thanks Josh Triplett for the idea.)
  * Add build dep on libghc6-testpack-dev. Closes: #603016
  * Avoid using runghc to run test suite as it is not available on all
    architectures. Closes: #603006

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Nov 2010 14:23:23 -0400

git-annex (0.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix support for file:// remotes.
  * Add --verbose
  * Fix SIGINT handling.
  * Fix handling of files with unusual characters in their name.
  * Fixed memory leak; git-annex no longer reads the whole file list
    from git before starting, and will be much faster with large repos.
  * Fix crash on unknown symlinks.
  * Added remote.annex-scp-options and remote.annex-ssh-options.
  * The backends to use when adding different sets of files can be configured
    via gitattributes.
  * In .gitattributes, the git-annex-backend attribute can be set to the
    names of backends to use when adding different types of files.
  * Add fsck subcommand. (For now it only finds unused key contents in the
    annex.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 07 Nov 2010 18:26:04 -0400

git-annex (0.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * Can scp annexed files from remote hosts, and check remote hosts for
    file content when dropping files.
  * New move subcommand, that makes it easy to move file contents from
    or to a remote.
  * New fromkey subcommand, for registering urls, etc.
  * git-annex init will now set up a pre-commit hook that fixes up symlinks
    before they are committed, to ensure that moving symlinks around does not
    break them.
  * More intelligent and fast staging of modified files; git add coalescing.
  * Add remote.annex-ignore git config setting to allow completly disabling
    a given remote.
  * --from/--to can be used to control the remote repository that git-annex
    uses.
  * --quiet can be used to avoid verbose output
  * New plumbing-level dropkey and addkey subcommands.
  * Lots of bug fixes.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Oct 2010 16:39:29 -0400

git-annex (0.01) unstable; urgency=low
