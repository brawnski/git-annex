-- v2 adds hashing of filenames of content and location log files.
-- Key information is encoded in filenames differently, so
-- both content and location log files move around, and symlinks
-- to content need to be changed.
-- 
-- When upgrading a v1 key to v2, file size metadata ought to be
-- added to the key (unless it is a WORM key, which encoded
-- mtime:size in v1). This can only be done when the file content
-- is present. Since upgrades need to happen consistently, 
-- (so that two repos get changed the same way by the upgrade, and
-- will merge), that metadata cannot be added on upgrade.
--
-- Note that file size metadata
-- will only be used for detecting situations where git-annex
-- would run out of disk space, so if some keys don't have it,
-- the impact is minor. At least initially. It could be used in the
-- future by smart auto-repo balancing code, etc.
--
-- Anyway, since v2 plans ahead for other metadata being included
-- in keys, there should probably be a way to update a key.
-- Something similar to the migrate subcommand could be used,
-- and users could then run that at their leisure.
